/**
 * Events List Widget Template
 * This is the template for the output of the events list widget.
 * All the items are turned on and off through the widget admin.
 * There is currently no default styling, which is needed.
 *
 * This view contains the filters required to create an effective events list widget view.
 *
 * You can recreate an ENTIRELY new events list widget view by doing a template override,
 * and placing a list-widget.php file in a tribe-events/widgets/ directory
 * within your theme directory, which will override the /views/widgets/list-widget.php.
 *
 * You can use any or all filters included in this file or create your own filters in
 * your functions.php. In order to modify or extend a single filter, please see our
 * readme on templates hooks and filters (TO-DO)
 *
 * @return string
